Python/Django small project to manage hours bank and productivity of public employees. It's really small and fitted just to solve a problem of mine, as a manager who struggles to keep controlling the hours bank os my team members at a brazilian public agency.

The intention is to control the hours bank in an authomatic way. Each worker will click at a button to register the check in and check out at work. At the initial page, the workers will get informed about the credit or debit of hours they have, as well as the balance of their co-workers.

The development is still in early stage. I'm working on the hours bank app for now. Afterwards, the productivity app will be developed.
